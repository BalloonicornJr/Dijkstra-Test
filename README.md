# Dijkstra-Test
A short test implementing Dijkstra's Algorithm. Not very modifiable, but it works. To modify this, you can change the locations of each node. I hard-coded the connections between nodes (as seen in "sv", "gv", etc.), so you'll have to hard-code that too. I recommend writing it out on a sheet of paper. This is more a proof-of-concept than anything! 100% homemade.
